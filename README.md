## Problem statement
Automate the finding of hardware-efficient quantum circuits representing the lowest energy eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian and how to scale it.

## Solution
Use **TensorRL-QAS**.

## Why TensorRL-QAS?

✅ At least **10-fold** fewer CNOTs and circuit depth,

✅ **98% training time reduction** per episode,

✅ **2.4-fold** reduced depth under noise,

✅ **Training stability** across random initialization of neural networks,

compared to **RL and non-RL based QAS** approaches. Moreover,

✅ Pure **CPU based training** up to 8-qubit

✅ **Easily scalable to large quantum systems (by far 20-qubit)**


## The dependencies
```
conda create -n {name_your_environment} python=3.10
conda activate {name_your_environment}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running TensorRL-QAS

There are a total of two steps one need to follow to successfully execule **TensorRL-QAS**


- ###  Matrix produce state (MPS) generation then conversion to parametrized quantum circuit (PQC)
    **Run**
    ```
    python3 dmrg-to-qc/dmrg_to_qc.py
    ```
    The python script `dmrg_to_qc.py` uses density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) where it takes the Hamiltonian as input, then finds an MPS to approximate the ground state. The it maps the MPS to a PQC depending on the user provided **bond dimension** ($\chi$) of the MPS and the **number of layers**

    After executing the code will ask the user to input a number where each number belongs to the different molecular Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the Heisenberg model. Then you will be asked to provide the **bond dimension** ($\chi$) of the MPS and the **number of layers** of the PQC generated using the MPS with user provided $\chi$.

    - **mol_data/** contains all the molecules utilized in benchmarking TensorRL-QAS. 
    - **init_state_circ/** contains the **MPS -> PQC** converted circuits and the states of the MPS.
    - **mps2qc.py**, **stiefel_opt.py** and **tnqc_ansatze.py** represents the *MPS -> PQC*, *Riemannina optimization* and *Brickwork structure* which are the primary subroutines of `dmrg_to_qc.py`.

- ### QAS utilizing TensorRL

    - To train QAS utilizing **TensorRL (trainable) on noiseless scenario** run the following:
    ```
    python3 Tensor_training_and_structureRL_noiseless.py --seed {seed} --config {config} --experiment_name "TensorRL_trainable/"
    ```

    - To train QAS utilizing **TensorRL (fixed) on noiseless scenario** run the following:
    ```
    python3 TensorRL_fixed_noiseless.py --seed {seed} --config {config} --experiment_name "TensorRL_fixed/"
    ```


    - To train QAS utilizing **StructureRL on noiseless scenario** run the following:
    ```
    python3 Tensor_training_and_structureRL_noiseless.py --seed {seed} --config {config} --experiment_name "structureRL/"
    ```


Where `seed` defines the random initialization fo the weights and biases of the neural network and `config` is the `configuration` in `configuration_files/` folder.
